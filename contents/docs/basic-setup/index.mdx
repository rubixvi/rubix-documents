## Documents

Welcome to **Documents**, a powerful and flexible Next.js documentation starter kit designed to simplify the process of creating high-quality, comprehensive
product documentation, technical manuals, and business guides. Built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**, this starter kit provides the
foundation to build your project documentation and knowledge base.

Documents was crafted to streamline the creation, management and showcasing of documentation, allowing developers and teams to focus on the content rather
than building the underlying structure. This documentation aims to help you get up and running with the kit, exploring the various features and providing
insights into how to structure and present your content effectively.

## Why Documents?

Documents was created as an open-source project to help the community streamline their documentation process, enabling developers to focus on more critical

The integration of MDX, custom components and Tailwind CSS ensures an intuitive experience, simplifying both content creation and management.

- **Product Guides**: Comprehensive manuals for product usage, setup and troubleshooting.
- **Business Documentation**: Clear and structured documentation for internal processes, policies and systems.
- **Technical Manuals**: Detailed guides for APIs, software development kits (SDKs) and technical processes.

Documents offers extensive customization options, allowing you to easily align the design and functionality with your branding.

## How to Use These Documents

You'll find the documentation's navigation bar on the left side of the screen. The pages are organized in a logical sequence, progressing from foundational
topics to more advanced concepts, allowing you to follow along step-by-step as you build your documentation. However, feel free to explore the content in
any order, selecting the sections most relevant to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, a table of contents provides easy navigation between sections of each page. For quick access to specific content, you can
use the search bar at the top or the search shortcut (`Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`).
