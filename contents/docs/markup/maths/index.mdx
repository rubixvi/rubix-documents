## Basic Algebra

The area of a circle ($$A$$) can be calculated using the radius ($$r$$) as follows:

```math
A = \pi r^2
```


## Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula for solving an equation of the form $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$ is:

```math
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
```

## Newton's Second Law of Motion

Newton's second law of motion states that force ($$F$$) is the product of mass ($$m$$) and acceleration ($$a$$):

```math
F = ma
```

## Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle:

```math
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

## Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence

Einstein's famous equation relates energy ($$E$$), mass ($$m$$), and the speed of light ($$c$$):

```math
E = mc^2
```
