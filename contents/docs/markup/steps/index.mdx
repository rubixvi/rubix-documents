The `<Step>` and `<StepItem>` components allow you to create structured step-by-step guides in your documentation. These components are particularly useful when you want to break down a process or tutorial into easy-to-follow stages.

## Steps

To create a step-by-step guide in your MDX, you can use the following structure:

<Step>
  <StepItem title="Install Node.js">
    Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org).
    
    To verify the installation, run the following command:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Install Dependencies">
    After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Run the Project">
    Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    You can access the application at:

    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000
    ```
  </StepItem>
