## Installation

<Step>
<StepItem title="Clone the Repository">
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rubixvi/rubix-documents.git
  ```

Change the directory to the project folder:

  ```bash
  cd rubix-documents
  ```

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Install Dependencies">

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file, including:

  - Next.js
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - MDX components
  - Other dependencies like ESLint, PostCSS, Husky, etc.
