Use this diagram to map workflows, decision-making processes, or operational flows.\n\n```jsx\n<Mermaid\n  chart={\\`\n    graph TD;\n    Start --> Task1;\n    Task1 --> Task2;\n    Task2 --> End;\n  \\`}\n/>\n```\n\n## Decision Tree\n\nDecision trees illustrate choices and possible outcomes, making them ideal for decision-making workflows or processes involving multiple paths.\n\n```jsx\n<Mermaid\n  chart={\\`\n    graph TD;\n    A[Start] --> B{Is it raining?};\n    B -->|Yes| C[Take an umbrella];\n    B -->|No| D[Enjoy the weather];\n    C --> E[Go outside];\n    D --> E;\n  \\`}\n/>\n```\n\n## Entity-Relationship Diagram\n\nEntity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) are used to model relationships between entities in a system. They are widely used in database design and system architecture planning.\n\n```jsx\n<Mermaid\n  chart={\\`\n    erDiagram\n    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places\n    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains\n    PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE-ITEM : \"included in\"\n    CUSTOMER {\n        string name\n        string email\n    }\n    ORDER {\n        int orderNumber\n        date orderDate\n    }\n    LINE-ITEM {\n        int quantity\n        float price\n    }\n    PRODUCT {\n        int productId\n        string name\n        float price\n    }\n  \\`}\n/>\n```\n\nEach of these diagrams serves a specific purpose and Mermaid makes it easy to generate them dynamically. Feel free to experiment with the provided code snippets and adapt them to your needs.\n",
